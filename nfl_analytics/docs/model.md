# Model

The model itself is a simple linear regression model. This was intended as a starting point with many different avenues for improvement, but it's performance isnt too bad. The mean absolute error is around 10. I could not find an average difference for Vegas odds but according to [https://www.theonlycolors.com/2020/9/29/21492301/vegas-always-knows-a-mathematical-deep-dive](Vegas Always Knows? A Mathematical Deep Dive) the standard deviation of Vegas spreads are around 14. That is, 68% of games are within 14 points of the spread, and 32% are higher. Thus, a mean absolute error of 10 seems like we're in the ballpark even if not really competitive.
